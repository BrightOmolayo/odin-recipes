              <li>First, get your core  ingredients ready. Efo Riro is a fast cooking dish,
                 so you’ll need to be proactive.image
            
                imageNow, season the meats, add sliced onions and boil on medium heat. 
                Remember to boil the tougher meats first, then add the softer ones.
                 Just before it’s fully cooked, add the Stockfish, boil till tender and set aside.
                
                Sorry, I haven’t got photos of the meat prep process
                 cos I usually boil my meats in bulk and store for future use.
                
                Wash your vegetables thoroughly with hot water 
                to rid it of all traces of dirt, be careful not to
                 in soak in hot water for too long so as to retain 
                 the nutrients. Slice or chop according to your preference and 
                 set aside.

                an onion coarsely and set aside…image

                t up on medium heat for 2 minutes ….imageThen add onions, fry till fragrant.image
                Then add the locust beans, fry to release the

                 let that fry for 15-20 minutes thereabouts or 
                 until the pepper dries out and 
                the size reduces by almost half….imageThe
